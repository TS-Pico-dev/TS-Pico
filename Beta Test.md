# TS-Pico Firmware Beta Test 
Thank you for agreeing to help the Pico team test the new firmware.

## The testing board

You have received standard TS-Pico hardware with a pre-programmed Raspberry Pi Pico and the Pico-custom ROM image on flash. 

The P10 jumper should be connected on your TS-Pico. If it is not, please connect it now.
